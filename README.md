# Registration Form — FreeCodeCamp Project

This project is part of the **Responsive Web Design** certification on FreeCodeCamp. It involves building a fully functional and responsive registration form using HTML and basic form validation techniques.

## ​ Project Overview

- **Objective**: Create a registration form that collects user information such as name, email, password, age, gender, and more.
- **Key Requirements**:
  - Use semantic HTML form elements.
  - Include form controls such as `<input>`, `<select>`, `<textarea>`, etc.
  - Implement form validation using form attributes (e.g., `required`, `minlength`, `maxlength`, `pattern`).
  - Ensure accessibility through properly associated `<label>` elements.
  - Apply responsive design principles so the form looks good on various screen sizes.
  - Use a `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` where appropriate to organize grouped inputs.
